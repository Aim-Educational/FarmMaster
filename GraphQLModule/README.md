# GraphQLModule

This module is responsible for providing GraphQL capabilities.

Other modules can make use of `GraphQLPart` to provide their own queries and mutations.

P.S. The entire GraphQL architecture for FarmMaster is so fucked in terms
of it being a performance nightmare. It's gonna bite me in the ass in the future, I can already tell.
